# Security

There is no security anywhere. Anyone can do anything as long as it has access to the URL.

This is to avoid unnecessary work on a private network and speed up development time.

# Back-end

Running with Spring Boot.

# Front-end

Running with Vue.js and Node.js.

## Pages

| Route                          | Description                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| /                              | Home                       |
| /beacons                       | Beacons list               |

| /beacon/{id}/edit              | Beacon edition             |
| /beacon/stop-reason/group/{id} | Stop reason group details  |

## Internationalization

Every page will have a full internationalization (or i18n for short) support to enable anyone to fully understand what going on.

### Supported Languages

| Short                         | Completeness  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| raw (remain to be translated) | ~80%          |
| en                            | ~20%          |
| fr                            | ~20%          |

Usually both language are applied at the same time to avoid loosing time of what has been already translated and what is remaining. But to speed up developement process, language are only applied to module that are in a working state.

Adding a language is a easy process: for every graphical interface, there is a file i18n.js contained in the /plugins/ directory. Just copy-paste one of the currently defined languages to add another one.

# Beacon

## Authentication

A beacon authenticate itself by using the MAC address of the first physical network interface available by the hardware.

Without being identified, the `back-end` will refuse any request/response/event coming from this unauthenticated connection. This is to ensure that a packet is not being randomly sent without knowing the origin.

## Client

The `beacon client` is running on a Raspberry Pi, allowing to wire sensors and access to a network. It will responsible to manage the current state of the graphical interface (a.k.a the operator view).

Running with Spring Boot, it is connected to the `back-end` through a WebSocket, allowing for instant bi-directional communication. In case where the link is not connected or has been broken, the `beacon` must buffer the information that is has to send back to the `back-end`. Once the link is connected (or restored), the `beacon` must authenticate first and then flush his awaiting requests.

## Operator View

The operator view is a page where a person being can see exactly what is currently being done in real-time through a WebSocket. To ensure that everyone is seeing the same data, all the message coming from the `beacon` are being broadcast to all currently connected sockets.

## Responses

Responses are usually answers to requests but can also provide initial data when you are not expecting them.

### response/auth

Authentication result. In some case, the server might return an error while trying to recognize the beacon. If such error append, the beacon retry in a few seconds. In the case where there is already a locally saved configuration file stored, this file will be used but the authentication retries will continue.

| Property | Type                                                                 | Description                                |

### response/connected-beacon-list

Sent by the `back-end`, the receiver get the list of the currently connected beacons' unique. The `front-end` will update views depending on the result.

|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| uniques  | List&lt;String&gt; | Currently connected beacons' unique |

### response/family-changed

Sent by the `beacon`, the `operator view` will unlock the buttons and continue as normal. But if the `familyId` is `0`, that mean the change has failed because the target product family does not exists: the `operator view` will have to ask for a new product family selection.

| Property | Type | Description                                                           |

| familyId | Long | Now current active product family, or 0 if the target does not exists |

### response/reported

Sent by the `beacon`, the `operator view` will unlock the buttons and continue as normal. But if the `success` is `false`, that mean the report has failed because the target stop reason does not exists: the `operator view` will not stop, but the incident will be reported to the `back-end` that will maybe have more chance to identify where the problem is.

| Property | Type | Description                                                           |

| familyId | Long | Now current active product family, or 0 if the target does not exists |

### response/workstation-state
